Modules:
- materials_plots: Publication-quality visuals for System 8 (materials invariance)
- rg_analysis_plots: Animated RG flow and fixed-point visualizations (System 9)
- scale_invariance_plots: Animated proof of scale invariance (Systems 1–3)
- tpu_benchmark_plots: Animated TIS quality ladder and TPU benchmarking visuals (System 9)
 - quenching_plots: Animated quenching process (phase evolution during cooling) for sword steel (System 8)
 - deposition_plots: Animated vapor deposition during semiconductor crystal growth (System 8)
 - unhinged_sampler_animations: Novel, aesthetic animations driven by sampler_interface (art-first)
   - includes scale waves and scale islands highlighting stability under α-sweeps
   - includes an oblique isomorphism view: extreme-angle overlays showing the law vs control
